* Discussion Questions Geometry :disc_ques_purpose:
The purpose for these discussion questions is to get people thinking of concretely measuring abstract entities.
:end:
1. Can we measure ideas?
2. What is the /shortest/ path between an image of a fish and an image of a man?
3. How do we transit from our current beliefs about the future starting only with our past observations?

* Some Motivating Ideas
  1. Algebra and Geometry - what are the differences?
  2. Which of the two is more relevant for brain and cognitive modelling?

* Article Questions
1. From the students
2. From me
   1. Explain untangling.
   2. Explain why a neural manifold may or may not be a manifold?

* What is a manifold?
A manifold is a "thingie" that can be as weird as you want it to be, but that is locally like $\mathbb{R}^n$. Let's examine what that statement means and some of the terminology those who talk about it like to use. 
** Points
   You can follow your intuition here. It is a thing. An object. A recognizable separate element of the space you are interested in. You may represent it by coordinate values $(x_1, x_2 ... x_n)$ or you could think of it as a vector. There are other conceptions too. 
** Sets
   For us, in this context,  a /set/ is just a collection of points. 
** Open Sets
   A set is open if it's complement is closed. This may strike you as being underspecified, but it is really just very general and allows us a lot of freedom to create the criteria by which /openess/ of our sets will be judged. Often, it is useful to have the intuition that it is a set with no sharp edges. If you have a *metric* on your space then you can define the open sets via a notion that all the points in your set have some small $\epsilon$ (measured by your distance metric) that is also in the set. There is no hard border that you can come up against. 
** Topology
   For a given set $X$ a topology is a collection of subsets of $X$ that are all open and that together (via *unions*) will include all the points you have in the set $X$.
** Topological Spaces
   The tuple of the set $X$ and the collection of open subsets that comprise the topology is the /topological space./ Usually these are not unique for a set $X$.
** Homeomorphisms
   To come to grips with the ideas it often helps to start small. Think of two or three dimensions where you can sketch a diagram or look at an object, but realize it scales up to arbitrarily large numbers of dimensions....IAMHERE

This article talks about the population doctrine in neuroscience, and talks about the new ideas from geometry like the neural manifold.
