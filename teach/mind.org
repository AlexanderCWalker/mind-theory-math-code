* Pr√©cis
  Our continuing discussion of what constitutes "mind," and more specifically what is a computational theory of mind, and how does it benefit, if at all, from a reliance on neural implementations of brains?

** Comments on the computing languages
   - Ideas about the different languages?
   - Who likes what? Do we have any groups naturally emerging?
   - Shall I just randomly assign?
   - Rotate weekly or concentrate across term?

* Further thoughts on the article: What is cognition?
