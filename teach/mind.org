* Pr√©cis
  Our continuing discussion of what constitutes "mind," and more specifically what is a computational theory of mind, and how does it benefit, if at all, from a reliance on neural implementations of brains?

* Getting github (small group activity)

  
* Where were we?

** Comments on the computing languages
   - Ideas about the different languages?
   - Who likes what? Do we have any groups naturally emerging?
   - Shall I just randomly assign?
   - Rotate weekly or concentrate across term?

* Further thoughts on the article: What is cognition?

* Discussion Questions to keep in /Mind/
1. What is the difference between something being mental and something being cognitive?
2. Are models of brains necessary for models of minds?
3. Does a model of mind (or of some mental process) necessarily have to deal with consciousness?

* Discussion Questions Computation
1. What are we missing if we omit "computation" and just talk about cognitive science or cognitive neuroscience?
2. What is the difference in meaning if we order the words "[[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022249611000368][computational cognitive neuroscience]]" or "[[https://2021.ccneuro.org/about.php][cognitive computational neuroscience]]"?
