* Pr√©cis
  Our continuing discussion of what constitutes "mind," and more specifically what is a computational theory of mind, and how does it benefit, if at all, from a reliance on neural implementations of brains?

  
* Where were we?

** Comments on the computing languages
   - Ideas about the different languages?
   - Who likes what? Do we have any groups naturally emerging?
   - Shall I just randomly assign?
   - Rotate weekly or concentrate across term?

** Further thoughts on the article: What is cognition?

** Discussions of Readings

* TODO Make class discussion questions and outlines for [[file:~/gitRepos/mind-theory-math-code/imports/computational-mind-book.org::*Chapter 20 Representation][Chapter 20 Representation]] then insert the file here. 

* Companion and Optional Readings
