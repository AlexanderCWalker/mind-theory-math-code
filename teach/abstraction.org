#+Title: Abstraction and Cognitive Neuroscience Modeling
#+Date: Winter 2022

  #+begin_quote
  The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise. --- Edsger Dijkstra

* Target Reading: Computing With Cognitive States

  A more detailed study of computational models of memory [[cite:&howard22_formal_model_memor_based_tempor_varyin_repres]]

  
* Question:
  1. What is the meaning of the word algebra here?

  2. Is this paper describing a theory (in the way we talked about it earlier)?
     
  3. How does the brain figure into the theory here?

  4. How does the development of ideas here relate to the mind - theory - math - code trajectory I proposed as useful?

  5. What language would be a good one for coding up this model?

  6. What critiques do you have of this model specifically (as opposed to the general outline that we just discussed)?

  7. What would be gained by making a model of this with spiking elements?
