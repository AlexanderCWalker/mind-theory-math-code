<p style="font-size:35px"><strong>Python Programming Language:</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:20px"><strong>Group: Sophia Tran, Troy Freiburger, Hanbin Go</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:30px"><strong>Intro:</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:20px">Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language that can
be used to solve a wide range of problems. It is one of the most rapidly
growing programming languages for data science, machine learning, and
academic research. Python is an object-oriented, interpreted programming
language. Modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high-level dynamic
data types, and classes are all included. It supports a variety of
programming paradigms other than object-oriented programming, including
procedural and functional programming. As an open-source program, it
will be fairly easy to collaborate with each other.</p>
<p style="font-size:30px"><strong>Installation:</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:20px">Python runs on many Unix variants including Linux and macOS, as well
as on Windows. Our group also downloaded Atom as our text-editor which
should also help facilitate group work and collaboration.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px">My first impression of downloading Python was that it was far easier
than I had anticipated. Miniconda was used to install Python 3 version.
Notwithstanding the difficulties that I and the members of
my group had in getting the Anaconda Prompt to run (difficulties which
were only relieved by the professor) the download itself was
straightforward. One challenge of downloading the program was that
(owing to a prior project of mine whose script was running on an earlier
and outdated version of Python) I needed to be able to have both the
outdated and updated versions of the software on my device. While
initially I thought that this would be a problem, I was surprised to
find out that this was a common matter and that a "Miniconda" program
was available which would allow me to house both versions on my device.
The availability of the Anaconda program which natively allowed for this
left me with the general first impression that the program would not be
so difficult to get into as I anticipated.</p>
<p style="font-size:30px"><strong>Practical:</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:20px">Python is an excellent first programming language for the majority of
people because it is a general-purpose, versatile, and powerful
programming language that is concise and easy to read. You must be
familiar with the Python console, often known as the shell, in order to
construct a "Hello World" example. It is a simple text-based interface
that accepts and executes your code as soon as you press Enter. To
create a "Hello World" message, one would require to type
<strong>print('hello world')</strong>. Almost every language has a form
of the print() function. The print() function is a useful function for
Python users to interact with the console during debugging.</p>
<p style="font-size:30px"><strong>Application:</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:20px">Nengo, for example, is a Python tool for creating large-scale
functional brain models. For implementation of Artificial Neural
Networks, we can use libraries such as PyTorch or Tensorflow.</p>
<p style="font-size:30px"><strong>Theoretical:</strong></p>
<p style="font-size:20px">Python is supposed to differ from other languages in its simplicity
and broad range of applicability. The key distinction of Python is this
simplicity in how easy it is to learn. Furthermore, it differs in
function from other languages (such as Java programs) in that Python
programs are expected to run slower while being quicker to develop.</p>
